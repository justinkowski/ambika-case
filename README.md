Case and Panel files for Mutable Instruments Ambika

![Ambika Complete](/photos/IMG_8144.jpeg)

NOTES:

- Panel SVG file is set up for use in Inkscape with the svg2shenzhen extension to export gerbers.

- Chassis + Cheek files come in two flavors depending on which length standoffs are used between the top panel and the main board.
  - The Ambika documentation specifies 10mm standoffs, but the 8mm version drops the panel a little closer to the display and is the one I've built.
  - The 10mm version is currently untested.

- Chassis is designed to be cut from 1.6mm thickness sheet metal. 5052 Aluminum is recommended. Steel should work as well, 6061 Aluminum is NOT recommended.

- Here are some US suppliers for laser-cut metal:
